/**
 * This provides the specification contracts for doing auth in the form of
 * Type Classes in [[auth.Access]] and [[auth.Identity]]
 *
 * Taking SAML 2.0 and OAuth2 as example flows, we have defined a set of contracts and abstractions on those
 * contracts to allow users of this library to implement instances of their specific authentication/authorization.
 *
 * The flow for a typical SAML/OAuth2 involves a protected resource, a client (web browser), and an Identity Provider.
 * Border Patrol can act as a translation layer for external representation of access and internal representation so
 * that services behind it do not need to implement SAML/OAuth2.
 *
 * The primary abstractions are:
 *   - `Identity` the external identity provider and types, e.g. SAML IdP
 *   - `Access` the internal access provider and types, e.g. api tokens, jwt etc
